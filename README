The Flying Camera


It's 1929 and Howard Houghes is making his movie about the Great War: Hell's Angels.
You are assigned to one of the planes equipped with a camera and your mission
is to film the planes around you as they simulate their dogfights.
Capture as many scenes as you can and always keep a watch for the Red Baron!
